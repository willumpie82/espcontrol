# Clean Merged Branch Folders

## Overview

Remove only local Git worktree folders whose branch is already merged to
`main`. Keep `main`, the current worktree, dirty worktrees, detached worktrees,
and unmerged branches untouched.

Use the bundled script for the candidate detection and removal. It dry-runs by
default and requires `--apply` before deleting any folder.

## Workflow

### 1. Check the Repository

Start from any worktree for this repository:

```bash
git status --short --branch
git worktree list
git fetch origin main --prune
```

Resolve the active worktree root before running bundled scripts so the command
also works when started from a subdirectory:

```bash
REPO_ROOT="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
```

Do not overwrite, revert, or remove local changes. If a worktree has uncommitted
changes, leave it alone and mention it in the final update.

### 2. Preview Cleanup Candidates

Run the script in dry-run mode first:

```bash
python3 "$REPO_ROOT/.agents/skills/clean-merged-branch-folders/scripts/clean_merged_worktrees.py"
```

The script treats a worktree as safe to remove when:

- the worktree is on a local branch, not `main` or another protected branch;
- the worktree is not the current working directory;
- the worktree has no uncommitted changes;
- the branch commit is already contained in `origin/main`, or GitHub reports a
  merged PR for that branch into `main`.

If GitHub CLI is unavailable or unauthenticated, the script still uses Git's
merge check. Squash-merged PR branches may require GitHub CLI because their
exact branch commits are often not ancestors of `main`.

### 3. Remove Merged Worktree Folders

After reviewing the dry-run output, remove only the listed safe candidates:

```bash
python3 "$REPO_ROOT/.agents/skills/clean-merged-branch-folders/scripts/clean_merged_worktrees.py" --apply
```

Leave local branch refs in place unless the user explicitly asks to delete them.
If branch deletion is requested, use:

```bash
python3 "$REPO_ROOT/.agents/skills/clean-merged-branch-folders/scripts/clean_merged_worktrees.py" --apply --delete-branches
```

The script uses `git branch -d`, not forced deletion, so branches that Git does
not consider merged are preserved.

### 4. Validate the Result

Confirm the cleanup:

```bash
git worktree list
git status --short --branch
```

Keep the final update plain and practical: list the folders removed, any folders
skipped, and whether local branch refs were kept or deleted.

## Safety Rules

- Never remove `main`, the current worktree, dirty worktrees, detached
  worktrees, or unmerged branches.
- Never use `rm -rf` for registered Git worktrees. Use `git worktree remove`.
- Never force-delete branches unless the user explicitly asks and the branch has
  been checked carefully.
- Do not close GitHub issues or merge pull requests as part of this cleanup.
