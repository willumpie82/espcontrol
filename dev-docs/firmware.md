# Firmware

Most EspControl firmware behavior is implemented as ESPHome components and
header-only C++ under `components/espcontrol/`.

## Runtime Model

1. ESPHome YAML creates LVGL objects and exposes text/select/number/switch
   entities.
2. The grid code reads saved button config from text entities.
3. `parse_cfg` normalizes the saved compact string into `ParsedCfg`.
4. Visual setup creates the card face.
5. Runtime wiring subscribes to Home Assistant state where needed and attaches
   tap/hold handlers.
6. Some cards open a shared full-screen modal.

Visual setup and runtime wiring are separate. A new card often needs both.

Media slider visuals own their runtime context as soon as visual setup creates
them. Teardown must cancel both geometry and media-position timers, remove the
parent resize callback, and clear LVGL user data before freeing the context.
This ownership starts before Home Assistant data binding because startup or a
dashboard rebuild can replace the visual during that gap.

P4 crash-report handlers deliberately use the direct reboot path after clearing
the saved report. Marking safe mode successful or using a safe reboot there
clears ESPHome's failed-boot counter and can prevent recovery from a recurring
startup crash.

Image-card context capacity is generated from the product profile's
`capabilities.imageSlots`, alongside downloader wiring. The S3 two-slot package
extends the shared constrained package. Cache reuse and expiry scheduling use
the same host-tested lifetime policy, including clock rollover and timestamp zero.
The S3 retention window starts on modal close; reopening a matching retained
image skips the modal download. Camera transfer errors invalidate modal reuse
and show Unavailable in both views. Retries back off from 2 to 30 seconds,
including while the modal is open; explicit unavailable/unknown entity states
suspend downloads until Home Assistant reports recovery.

## Adding Firmware Support for a Card

Use an existing card with similar behavior as the architectural template:

- Static display card: sensor-like or time-like cards.
- Toggle/action card: switch/action cards.
- Rich modal card: media, climate, or light cards.
- Image loading card: camera or media cover-art behavior.

The [firmware UI playbook](playbooks/change-firmware-ui.md) owns exact firmware
edit and verification steps. Use the [card playbook](playbooks/add-card-type.md)
when the contract and web configurator also change.

## Modal Pattern

Cards that open a full-screen detail view use the shared modal system. A central
definition owns presentation, chrome, and dismissal policy; a small context
stores card state; the runtime pass attaches interaction; and the shared shell
owns layout. See [Modal Layout System](modal-layout-system.md) for the full
ownership model.

For a simple static card, the context usually needs the button pointer, display
font pointers, width compensation, and any text or state the modal should render.
For cards that subscribe to Home Assistant state, keep the context updated from
the subscription callback and guard async work as described in the LVGL gotchas
below.

Modal layout changes must preserve the geometry fixtures for every display
profile or deliberately update the fixtures and generated visual reference.
The firmware UI playbook owns the required checks.

## Fonts and Glyphs

Firmware fonts only contain the glyphs declared in YAML. Missing glyphs render
as boxes.

- Device font definitions: `devices/<slug>/device/fonts.yaml`
- Shared glyph sets: `common/assets/*glyphs.yaml`
- Icon registry: `product/v2/icons.json`
- Icon lookup in firmware: `components/espcontrol/icons.h`

Use font role substitutions from device profiles instead of hardcoding one
device's physical font id in card logic.

## Home Assistant Bindings

Cards that reflect Home Assistant state must subscribe to the entity or
attribute they need. Keep subscriptions narrow because display memory and update
work are limited.

The shared subscription coordinator stores its container backing and callback
ownership blocks in external RAM when available, with internal RAM as the
allocator fallback. Climate cards always subscribe to capability lists, but
subscribe to current preset, fan, and swing values only when their configured or
effective fallback controls need them. An optional subscription stays registered
for that card context; narrowing a configuration can therefore leave its upstream
channel in the append-only coordinator history until reboot.

Each climate context owns its callbacks and releases them before deletion; a
shared page callback scope is restored after registration. Optional registration
failures stay pending on the guarded 250 ms timer, which rechecks current
capabilities and stops once the work completes or its contexts are removed.

Subscription diagnostics report `container_bytes` as persistent vector capacity,
including nested lists. `alloc_external_bytes` and `alloc_internal_bytes` track
all live allocations made by the adapter, including shared callback blocks and
any active dispatch snapshots. String payloads, allocations inside `std::function`,
and ESPHome transport storage are excluded from both measurements.

The firmware host tests include the climate subscription maintenance helper
directly and generate a harness for registration and context-deletion functions. It uses the issue
fixture to count registered channels and a fake transport/timer to check delayed
delivery and rebuilds; LVGL rendering and physical memory behaviour still need
device testing.

Use the firmware UI playbook for subscription and runtime checks.

## Cover Art activation and the S3 stack

ESPHome's automation actions call the next action synchronously. Keep the 1 ms
yield at the start of `display_mode_effect_cover_art`: layout and logging must
not inherit the controller's nested action stack. Keep artwork preparation in
the restartable `cover_art_prepare_activation` script with its own yield. The
parent waits for preparation before completing the transition. After the yield,
validate transition generation, subscription generation, media entity and
feature eligibility; obsolete work must not select or download artwork.

`cover_art_request_artwork` already selects cached candidates. Do not add a
second cached-selection call to activation. Image consumers continue sharing
the existing serialized download queue.

`tests/firmware/cover_art_activation_test.py` executes the production scheduling
and artwork-selection bodies with an ESPHome action-chain excerpt and simulated
LVGL/network/scheduler boundaries. Its `--mutations` option verifies the yields
and ownership guards. Use `--esphome-source <generated-src>/esphome` after a
toolchain update to verify the excerpt against the installed automation code.
Run it with a Python environment containing PyYAML (the pinned ESPHome
environment provides this dependency and CI reuses it).

The anonymized `tests/firmware/fixtures/issue1854-cover-art.json` backup preserves
the reporter's tile, 60-second Cover Art delay, presence dimming, music sleep
prevention and 90-degree rotation. Replace all `media_player.issue1854` and
`binary_sensor.issue1854_presence` values with bench entities before importing.
The native payload is omitted so it cannot override the anonymized legacy
fields. Test five cold boots, 20 playback/track changes, 20 screensaver/wake
cycles and 30 minutes of playback on the 4-inch S3, followed by a 7-inch P4
smoke test. Check both crashes and text corruption.

Home Assistant reconnect recovery lives in the restartable
`ha_refresh_after_connect` script. A Home Assistant disconnect cancels its delayed
refreshes only when no authenticated Home Assistant connection remains. An old
socket disconnecting must preserve a replacement's recovery and pending requests,
including before state subscriptions are ready. Diagnostic API clients must not
start or cancel that work. Artwork recovery
rechecks source URLs without forcing a healthy cached image to download again.
Real metadata changes still force a refresh when a provider reuses its URL.
That refresh requirement survives attribute timeouts until artwork is handed to
the download path; retries for a missing optional attribute then stay unforced.

## Config Parser Rules

`button_grid_config.h` should accept existing saved values after an upgrade. Be
careful with:

- renamed card types
- renamed option keys
- new required fields
- default values that change behavior
- clearing unknown options

When parser behavior changes, update compatibility fixtures. Use the firmware UI
playbook and, for saved-shape changes, the
[saved-config playbook](playbooks/change-saved-config.md) for verification.

## ESPHome Entry Points

Each device has:

- `devices/<slug>/esphome.yaml` - production entry, pulls remote packages.
- `devices/<slug>/dev.yaml` - local development entry, points components at the
  working tree.
- `devices/<slug>/packages.yaml` - package and substitution manifest.

For local firmware work, build from `dev.yaml`.

## Logs and Debugging

Stream logs over the ESPHome native API:

```bash
cd devices/<slug>
esphome logs dev.yaml --device <device-ip>
```

Boot-time logs print once at startup. Connecting after boot does not replay them,
so connect before rebooting or trigger the relevant behavior again.

Use ESPHome logging macros in firmware headers:

```cpp
ESP_LOGI("mytag", "value=%s", v.c_str());
ESP_LOGD("mytag", "debug value=%s", v.c_str());
```

Remove or downgrade noisy logs before finalizing a change.

## LVGL Gotchas

- A container does not lay out children unless a layout is set, such as
  `lv_obj_set_layout(..., LV_LAYOUT_FLEX)` plus a flex flow.
- Labels that should clamp need a fixed width or height and
  `lv_label_set_long_mode(lbl, LV_LABEL_LONG_DOT)`.
- Grid widgets such as `button_N` are persistent. Reconfiguring a card rebuilds
  its context and points `user_data` at the new context. If a card creates a
  timer or async callback, check that the button still points at the same context
  before writing to shared labels.
