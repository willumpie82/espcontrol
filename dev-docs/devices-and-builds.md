# Devices and Builds

Device support is authored in `product/v2/device_catalog.json` plus per-device ESPHome YAML
under `devices/<slug>/`. `devices/manifest.json` is a generated, committed
compatibility copy for existing tools.

## Device Catalog and Compatibility Manifest

`product/v2/device_catalog.json` defines:

- public name and docs path
- screen size, resolution, and orientation
- slot count and grid layout
- web preview sizing and drag behavior
- supported rotation values
- firmware chip family
- firmware font roles
- display-specific options
- package substitutions and release metadata

The catalog contains reusable profile categories and ordered device entries. Run
`python3 scripts/generate_device_manifest.py` after editing it. Validators check
that the expanded manifest is current before generated files are accepted.

## Per-Device Folder Shape

Each supported display normally has:

```text
devices/<slug>/
  esphome.yaml
  dev.yaml
  packages.yaml
  device/
    device.yaml
    fonts.yaml
    lvgl.yaml
    sensors.yaml
```

Some devices also include extra files for network coprocessors, ethernet, or
touchscreen variants.

## Production vs Local Development

Use `esphome.yaml` for the production package shape. It is the path end users
install.

Use `dev.yaml` for local work. It points ESPHome at local component sources under
`components/`, so firmware changes can be compiled before they are published.

`dev.yaml` does that with a local `external_components` override:

```yaml
external_components:
  - source:
      type: local
      path: ../../components
    components: [espcontrol, web_server_idf]
    refresh: 1s
```

The helper injects `dev` as the `firmware_version`. That version appears in
ESPHome logs, Home Assistant diagnostics, and the firmware version sensor.
Running `esphome run dev.yaml` directly still works, and it uses the same static
fallback version from `devices/<slug>/packages.yaml`.

OTA upload only works after the display is already running EspControl firmware
and is connected to the network. First flash is over USB.

The [supported-device playbook](playbooks/add-supported-device.md) owns local
compile/upload commands and explicit target selection.

## Generated Device Outputs

Device-profile changes can regenerate:

- `docs/public/device-profiles.json`
- `docs/generated/screens/*.md`
- generated blocks in `devices/*/packages.yaml`
- generated blocks in `devices/*/device/sensors.yaml`
- files under `docs/public/webserver/` when web profile data changes

The supported-device playbook owns the generator order and verification checks.

## Web Bundle Output

Each device gets a bundle at:

```text
docs/public/webserver/<slug>/www.js
```

Generated bundles are committed even when firmware bundles them locally. Older
installed firmware can still point at the GitHub Pages copy of this path, while
new `builds/*.yaml` entry points use `web_server.js_include` so the setup page
matches the firmware branch being flashed. Local testing can still override
`web_server.js_url` to load a bundle served from a development machine.

`scripts/build.py` derives each device profile and passes it to the Node bundle
builder. That builder uses esbuild's API to produce a minified browser IIFE with
an ES2020 target. VM and browser smoke tests build fresh copies through the same
pipeline instead of reading the committed files. The web configurator playbook
owns normal regeneration; the generator also supports isolated temporary output
for tests and diagnostics.

## Firmware Build Artifacts

Release-facing firmware YAML lives in `builds/`:

```text
builds/<slug>.yaml
builds/<slug>.factory.yaml
```

Release checks validate that these outputs stay aligned with device profiles and
public firmware expectations.

## Device Build Flags

Per-device `platformio_options.build_flags` are escape hatches. Prefer manifest
data, shared packages, or generated device slots for normal device differences.
The exact flag/device mapping below is generated from every device YAML and its
local shared-package include graph, including `build_flags` and
`build_src_flags` lists. Maintainers own the purpose and removal criteria in
`dev-docs/build-flag-notes.json`.

Run `python3 scripts/check_dev_docs.py --update` after a device flag or its notes
change. `npm run check:dev-docs` fails for a stale mapping, an undocumented flag,
or notes for a flag that no device uses.
