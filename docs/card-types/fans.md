  How to use fan cards on your EspControl panel to control Home Assistant fan entities.

# Fans

Fan cards are grouped controls for Home Assistant `fan` entities. They can show all fan controls in one modal, a fan switch, speed slider, oscillation toggle, direction control, or preset picker.

Use Fan cards when you want fan-specific controls. Use [Slider](/card-types/sliders) when you only need a simple fan speed slider, or [Switch](/card-types/switches) when you only need basic on/off fan control.

## Setting Up a Fan Card

1. Select a card and change its type to **Fans**.
2. Choose the fan **Type**:
   - **All Controls** opens one larger control view with the fan features your Home Assistant integration supports.
   - **Switch** turns the fan on or off.
   - **Speed** lets you drag a vertical slider from 0 to 100 percent.
   - **Oscillation** toggles fan oscillation when the integration supports it.
   - **Direction** changes fan direction when the integration supports it.
   - **Preset** opens the fan's preset mode list when presets are available.
3. Enter the **Fan Entity**, for example `fan.bedroom`.
4. Set a **Label** if you want custom text. If left blank, the friendly name from Home Assistant is used when available.
5. Choose the icon fields shown for the selected type.

## Fan Types

| Type | What it does | Home Assistant support needed |
|---|---|---|
| **All Controls** | Opens a large modal with power, speed, preset, oscillation, direction, and an optional separate-light tab. Unsupported tabs are hidden automatically. | The relevant fan features exposed by the integration |
| **Switch** | Turns the fan on or off and shows active state. | Basic `fan.turn_on` and `fan.turn_off` support |
| **Speed** | Sets fan percentage from 0 to 100. | Percentage speed support |
| **Oscillation** | Toggles oscillation. | Oscillating support |
| **Direction** | Switches fan direction. | Direction support |
| **Preset** | Shows available preset modes and sends the selected preset. | `preset_modes` support |

## How It Works on the Panel

- **All Controls** opens a full-screen fan view. It can show tabs for Power, Speed, Preset, Oscillation, Direction, and an optional Light. The panel hides tabs that the selected fan or configured light do not support.
- **Switch** behaves like a fan-specific Switch card with separate off and on icons.
- **Speed** behaves like a vertical slider and follows fan speed changes made elsewhere in Home Assistant.
- **Oscillation** shows and toggles the current oscillation state.
- **Direction** sends the supported direction change for the fan integration.
- **Preset** opens a picker using the preset modes Home Assistant reports for the entity.

Not every Home Assistant fan integration supports every feature. If a control does not appear to do anything, check the fan entity in Home Assistant and confirm the integration exposes that capability.

## All Controls Tabs

All Controls includes a **Visible Tabs** setting. Use it to reorder tabs or turn off controls you do not want on the device. The device still checks the fan entity at runtime, so unsupported tabs stay hidden even if they are enabled in the card settings.

If your fan has a separate light in Home Assistant, open **Optional Light** in the modal settings and select its `light.*` entity. The Light tab is added automatically, can be moved to any position in **Visible Tabs**, and can be turned off there without removing the saved entity. It provides on/off control only.

::: info Requires Home Assistant actions
Fan cards send Home Assistant fan actions from the panel. If tapping or dragging a card does nothing, check [Enable Actions](/getting-started/home-assistant-actions).
