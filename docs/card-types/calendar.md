# Date & Time

A date and time card can show the local clock, just the date, or the local date and time. In clock mode, only the time is shown. In date-only mode, the large number shows the day and the label underneath shows the month. In date-and-time mode, the large number shows the local time and the label underneath shows the day and month.

Date and clock cards are read-only — tapping them does nothing.

## Setting Up a Date or Clock Card

1. Select a card and change its type to **Date & Time**.
2. Choose **Clock**, **Date**, or **Time & Date** from the **Type** dropdown.
3. On a **Wide** or **Large** card, turn on **Large Clock** if you want the main value scaled much larger. On a **Wide** card, the label underneath is hidden so the larger value has room.
4. Apply the configuration so the panel restarts with the new card.

## How It Works on the Panel

- In **Clock** mode, the card uses the panel's own synced time source and shows no date label.
- In **Date only** mode, the card reads `sensor.date`, and it also falls back to the panel's own time source.
- In **Date & time** mode, the large time display follows the timezone and 12/24-hour setting selected in [Time Settings](/features/clock).
- The label underneath follows the same local timezone, so it stays matched to the time shown above.
- The panel publishes a **Screen: Date** diagnostic value, so you can check whether the device currently knows the date.
- The card uses the fixed **tertiary** background colour, like Sensor, World Clock, and Weather cards.
- If the panel has not synced time yet, the card shows `--` until time becomes available.

The same **Date & Time** card settings also include **World Clock**. Choosing that changes the card into a [World Clock](/card-types/timezones) card for another city or timezone.
