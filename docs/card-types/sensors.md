# Sensor

A Sensor card is read-only. It displays a Home Assistant `sensor`, `binary_sensor`, or `text_sensor`; it can also use a [Local Sensor](/card-types/local-sensors) from the panel itself.

## Set Up a Sensor Card

1. Select a card and change its type to **Sensor**.
2. Leave **Source** as **Home Assistant**, choose the display type, and enter the sensor entity.
3. Set a label, unit, and icon as needed.

| Type | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Numeric** | A live number, optional unit, and label. **Large Sensor Numbers** is available on Large cards. |
| **Time** | A compact duration such as `36m` or `1h 30m`. Leave **Incoming Value Unit** on Auto unless the entity does not report a usable unit. |
| **Text** | The live state beside a chosen icon. Advanced settings can replace up to two raw states with friendlier text. |
| **Icon** | A normal and optional active icon for a status-style sensor. |

Choose **Lit When Active** when an active status should use the on colour. It is not available for Time cards. Numeric cards treat values above zero as active; Text and Icon cards follow recognised Home Assistant active states.

## Useful Details

- A Time card needs a value in days, hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds, or microseconds. You can select the unit manually when Auto cannot identify it.
- Unknown, unavailable, or invalid values are left blank rather than guessed.
- Changes made in Home Assistant update the panel automatically.
- To show a device-local sensor, change **Source** to **Local Sensor** and follow the [Local Sensor](/card-types/local-sensors) setup.

| Example entity | Suggested type |
|---|---|
| `sensor.living_room_temperature` | Numeric |
| `sensor.ups_battery_runtime` | Time |
| `binary_sensor.laundry_running` | Icon |
| `text_sensor.washing_machine_status` | Text |
