# Screen Lock

A Screen Lock card locks and unlocks the panel's touchscreen controls locally. It does not need a Home Assistant entity and does not send a Home Assistant action.

Use this when a panel is in a shared area and you want a quick way to prevent accidental taps.

## Setting Up a Screen Lock Card

1. Select a card and change its type to **Screen Lock**.
2. Save the card and apply the configuration.

Screen Lock does not need an entity or any additional card settings. Its label and icon change automatically to show whether the touchscreen is locked or unlocked.

## How It Works on the Panel

- Tapping the card switches the panel between locked and unlocked states.
- The lock state is local to the panel.
- Other cards are protected while the screen is locked.
- The card can be used on the home screen or inside a subpage.
- It does not depend on Home Assistant availability.

Screen Lock is different from a [Lock](/card-types/locks) card. **Lock** controls a Home Assistant `lock` entity such as a door lock. **Screen Lock** controls the touchscreen's local interaction state.

## When to Use It

Screen Lock is useful for hallway panels, bedside panels, child-accessible panels, or any location where accidental control changes would be annoying.

For security-sensitive actions such as unlocking a door, use the Home Assistant lock's own security features, a Home Assistant script, or card-level confirmation where available. Screen Lock is a local interaction guard, not a replacement for Home Assistant permissions.
