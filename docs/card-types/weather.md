  How to show current Home Assistant weather conditions or daily high / low temperatures on your EspControl panel.

# Weather

A weather card displays weather information from a Home Assistant weather entity. It can show either the current condition, such as **Sunny**, **Cloudy**, or **Rainy**, or the high / low temperatures for today or tomorrow, such as **18/10°C**.

Weather cards are read-only — tapping them does nothing.

## Setting Up a Weather Card

1. Select a card and change its type to **Weather**.
2. Enter a **Weather Entity** — the Home Assistant weather entity ID you want to display, for example `weather.forecast_home`.
3. Choose **Display**:
   - **Current Conditions** shows the live weather condition icon and label.
   - **Temperatures Today** shows today's high / low temperature.
   - **Temperatures Tomorrow** shows tomorrow's high / low temperature.
4. For temperature displays, optionally enter a **Label** to override the default card label.
5. On a **Large** card, turn on **Large Temperature Numbers** if you want the high / low reading scaled much larger.

## How It Works on the Panel

- In **Current Conditions** mode, the card watches the weather entity's current state.
- In **Current Conditions** mode, the icon uses the normalized weather condition, while the label keeps provider-specific text from Home Assistant (for example, `light rain` is shown as **Light Rain** rather than being reduced to **Rainy**).
- In **Temperatures Today** and **Temperatures Tomorrow** modes, the card asks Home Assistant for the daily forecast for the configured weather entity.
- In temperature modes, the unit label comes from the panel's **Temperature Unit** setting.
- In temperature modes, the card label defaults to **Today** or **Tomorrow**, unless you set your own label.
- If Home Assistant reports `unknown`, `unavailable`, or an unexpected current condition, the card shows a fallback weather icon and a readable label.
- If the requested forecast is missing or unavailable, the card shows **--/--** instead of leaving the card blank.
- The card uses the fixed **tertiary** background colour, like Sensor, Date, Clock, and World Clock cards.

::: tip Home Assistant actions permission
The temperature displays need the same **Allow the device to perform Home Assistant actions** setting as control cards. EspControl uses that permission to request forecast data from Home Assistant.

## Temperatures Tomorrow

To show tomorrow's forecast high and low, create a **Weather** card and set **Display** to **Temperatures Tomorrow**. Enable [Home Assistant actions](/getting-started/home-assistant-actions) so the panel can request the forecast.

Older configurations containing a separate **Weather Forecast** card load as a Weather card with this setting. You do not need to recreate them.
