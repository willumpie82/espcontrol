# Troubleshooting

## Web Configuration Changes Won't Save

The web editor can load a compatible hosted update independently of the display's firmware. Reload the page to pick up a published fix; reflashing is usually unnecessary for a hosted editor problem.

If saving or importing a backup fails, try opening `http://YOUR-DISPLAY-IP/?espcontrol_fallback=1` to use the editor embedded in the firmware. Replace `YOUR-DISPLAY-IP` with the display's address. On builds with an embedded editor, this bypasses the hosted editor for that page load. Save one setting and reload to check that it persisted. Reopen the normal device address to return to the hosted editor.

## The Screen Doesn't Respond to Commands

- If the display shows your Home Assistant devices but nothing happens when you tap controls, such as turning lights on, Home Assistant actions probably need to be enabled for the display.
- Follow the [Enable Actions](https://jtenniswood.github.io/espcontrol/getting-started/home-assistant-actions) guide and make sure **Allow the device to perform Home Assistant actions** is turned on.

## The Install Button Doesn't Detect My Device

- Make sure you're using **Chrome or Edge** on a desktop computer. Mobile browsers and Safari/Firefox don't support the required browser feature (WebSerial).
- Try a **different USB-C cable**. Charge-only cables won't work.
- Try a **different USB port** on your computer.
- On Windows, you may need to install drivers — check Device Manager for an unrecognised device.

## The Display Is Stuck on the Loading Screen

- Give it up to 60 seconds after first boot. It needs time to connect to WiFi and download resources.
- If it stays on the loading screen, power-cycle it and check whether the WiFi hotspot appears. If it does, the display couldn't connect to your network — go through the WiFi setup again.
- If you need to report the problem, collect a startup log with the [USB log guide](/reference/collect-usb-logs) and include it in the GitHub issue.

## Home Assistant Doesn't Discover the Device

- Make sure the display and Home Assistant are on the **same WiFi network** (not a guest network or a different VLAN).
- In Home Assistant, go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Add Integration** and search for **ESPHome**. Enter the device's IP address manually.

## Home Assistant Says "Connection Requires Encryption"

- Update both Home Assistant and ESPHome Device Builder to 2026.8 or newer. These versions pass a display's unique API encryption key between Home Assistant and Device Builder when the display is adopted or rebuilt.
- If you already rebuilt the display and Home Assistant asks for a key, open its YAML in ESPHome Device Builder and use the existing `api.encryption.key` value in Home Assistant's reauthentication prompt. Do not generate a different key.
- Normal OTA updates retain the key stored on the display. Erasing the whole display during a USB install can remove it and may require pairing the display with Home Assistant again.
- See [Manual Setup](/getting-started/manual-esphome-setup) for more about automatic API encryption.

## A P4 Panel Has Unreliable WiFi

- P4 panels use a separate ESP32-C6 WiFi processor. Mismatched or outdated C6
  firmware can cause repeated disconnects, failed initial setup, or a panel that
  disappears from Home Assistant after restarting.
- Use the [C6 WiFi recovery installer](/getting-started/c6-recovery) to reinstall
  EspControl and repair the C6 over USB without depending on WiFi.
- This recovery is for P4 panels only, not the ESP32-S3 4848S040.

## The Web Page Looks Broken or Unstyled

- The device's web page loads some resources from the internet. Make sure the display has a working internet connection (not just local network access).
- Try clearing your browser cache and reloading.

## I Want to Start Over

- To re-flash the firmware, connect via USB-C and use the [install button](/getting-started/install#flash-the-firmware) again.
- To clear WiFi settings and start fresh, re-flash the device. It will create the setup hotspot again.

## I Need Help With a Bug

- Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/jtenniswood/espcontrol/issues/new) and describe the display model, firmware version, and what happened.
- For startup, WiFi, loading screen, or Home Assistant connection problems, include a USB log from the [Collect USB Logs](/reference/collect-usb-logs) guide.
