  How the EspControl panel automatically returns to the home screen after a period of inactivity.

# Idle

If you navigate to a [subpage](/features/subpages) or leave a popup open and walk away, the panel can automatically return to the home screen after a set amount of time. This keeps the display on the main card grid so it's ready to use the next time you glance at it.

## Settings

Configured in **Settings > Display > Idle** in [Setup](/features/setup).

**Return Home After** — how long the panel waits without a touch before switching back to the home screen. Choose from:

- **Disabled** — stay on whatever screen was last shown
- 10, 20, or 30 seconds
- **1 minute** (the default), 2 minutes, or 5 minutes

## How It Works

The idle timer restarts every time you touch the screen. If you're already on the home screen with no popup open, nothing changes. If a subpage or popup is active, the timer closes it and returns to the home screen.

The idle timer runs independently from the [screensaver](/features/screensaver). Each uses its own timeout; the panel only returns home first if the idle timeout is shorter.
