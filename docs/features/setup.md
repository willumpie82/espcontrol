# Configure Your Home Assistant Touchscreen

Your EspControl panel has a built-in web page where you can set everything up. Open it by typing the panel's address into any browser on your phone or computer.

### Adding a Card

Tap any empty space in the grid (shown as a dashed outline with a **+** icon), then choose a card type. Its configuration opens with the card name as the heading and the same settings layout used when editing a saved card. To choose a different card type, close the panel and start again from the empty space.

For cards that use Home Assistant, enter the entity name from Home Assistant in the **Entity** field, such as `light.living_room`, `switch.garden_lights`, `scene.movie_mode`, or `weather.forecast_home`. Some card types use a more specific label, such as **Sensor Entity**, **Weather Entity**, or **Climate Entity**. You can find entity names under **Settings > Devices & Services** in Home Assistant.

Some card names group several related controls together. **Lights** contains All Controls, Switch, Brightness, and Colour Temperature options. **Fans** contains All Controls, Switch, Speed, Oscillation, Direction, and Preset options. **Action** contains scene, script, helper, Option Select, and Local Action modes. **Sensor** contains Home Assistant and Local Sensor sources. **Vacuum** contains Status, Start / Stop, Dock, Pause / Resume, Spot Clean, Locate, and Clean Area options. **Lawn Mower** contains Status, Start Mowing, Dock, and Pause / Resume options. **Cover** contains All Controls, Position, Tilt, Toggle, Open, Close, Stop, and Set Position options. **Alarm** contains All Controls, Arm Away, Arm Home, Arm Night, Arm Vacation, and Disarm options. **Date & Time** contains Clock, Date, Time & Date, and World Clock options.

For the generated list of current card domains, subpage support, grouping, and options, see the [Card Capability Reference](/reference/card-capabilities).

Most cards also let you choose an icon and set a label. If the label is left blank, the panel uses the friendly name from Home Assistant when it can.

### Active Switch Display

Each [Switch](/card-types/switches) card has separate **Off Icon** and **On Icon** settings. The on icon is used while the entity is active.

You can also turn on **Active Display**:

- **Numeric** — show a live reading instead of the icon, for example temperature, power usage, or a percentage. Pick the **Sensor Entity**, **Unit**, and **Unit Precision**.
- **Text** — show a live text state instead of the label, for example a machine status or current mode.

When the entity is not active, the card goes back to its off icon and normal label.

### Moving Cards

Drag and drop any card to reposition it. If you drop it onto an occupied space, the existing card shifts to the next available slot.

To copy cards to another controller without replacing its other settings, use **Copy Code** and **Paste Code**. See [Copying Cards Between Controllers](/features/subpages#copying-cards-between-controllers) for the steps and compatibility notes.

### Card Sizes

Right-click a card and open **Size** to choose:

- **Single** - normal one-slot card.
- **Tall** - spans two rows.
- **Extra Tall** - spans three rows.
- **Wide** - spans two columns.
- **Extra Wide** - spans three columns.
- **Ultra Wide** - spans five columns and is available on screens with a five-column grid.
- **Large** - spans a 2 x 2 area.
- **Extra Large** - spans a 3 x 3 area and is available for Media cover-art cards.
- **Max Wide** - spans a 3 x 2 area and is available for Camera cards.
- **Max tall** - spans a 2 x 3 area and is available for Camera cards.
- **Massive Wide (3x4)** - spans three rows by four columns and is available for Camera cards when the current screen orientation has room.
- **Massive (4x3)** - spans four rows by three columns and is available for Camera and Media cover-art cards when the current screen orientation has room.

If a card already occupies the space needed for a larger size, the setup page tries to move it to the next available slot. If there is not enough room, the size change is not applied.

## Device Settings

The **Settings** tab groups the current controls as follows. Open a card to see its options; some options appear only when their feature is enabled.

| Section | Settings |
|---|---|
| **Display** | [Appearance](/features/appearance), [Backlight](/features/backlight), [Idle](/features/idle), [Clock Bar](/features/clock-bar), [Rotation](/features/rotation) |
| **Sleep & Schedule** | [Cover Art Screen Saver](/features/media-cover-art), [Screensaver](/features/screensaver), [Night Schedule](/features/screen-schedule) |
| **Preferences** | [Language](/features/language), [Time](/features/clock), [Temperature](/features/temperature) |
| **System** | [Device Name](#naming-your-panel), [Backup](/features/backup), [Firmware](/features/firmware-updates), [Home Assistant Settings](#home-assistant-settings), [Battery](/features/battery), [Factory Reset](/features/backup#reset-the-display) |

Device-specific settings, including Rotation and Battery, appear only on supported panels. Device Name and Factory Reset also require firmware that supports them.

### Home Assistant Settings

Open **Settings > System > Home Assistant Settings** to manage camera/image and media artwork connections. **Automatic** can use the local URL advertised by the connected Home Assistant instance when the URL uses the same IP address as the native ESPHome connection; it keeps the advertised protocol and port together. Home Assistant's separate Internet URL is not used.

The panel checks candidates in the background. If the advertised local URL cannot be reached, it checks the connected server's advertised HTTP port with the configured protocol, then the other protocol for a local/private address. Its final fallback uses the configured protocol and port with the connected server's IP. If multicast discovery is blocked or ambiguous, only that configured fallback is used; EspControl does not scan ports or guess hostnames.

The settings show the endpoint, its source (**Automatic**, **Fallback**, or **Manual**) and connection health. **Connection checked** means the public Home Assistant manifest responded; **Images received** means an image download succeeded. Access errors, camera errors and invalid images do not cause EspControl to switch servers. Repeated connection failures trigger a background recheck. Complete artwork URLs supplied by media services or external CDNs are preserved.

Choose **Manual** to set **Home Assistant Host** (optional), **Home Assistant Protocol** (`http` or `https`), and **Home Assistant Port** (1–65535). Leave Host blank to use the address of the connected Home Assistant API client. A hostname lets HTTPS use a certificate issued to that DNS name; the panel still verifies certificates, so a self-signed certificate must be trusted separately. Automatic discovery only accepts an advertised URL whose host is the same IP address as the connected Home Assistant API client. Use Manual for a hostname-based proxy or a proxy on a different host.

The native ESPHome connection and image downloads are separate connections. If controls work but images fail, compare the displayed endpoint with **Home Assistant > Settings > System > Network > Home Assistant URL > Local network**. **Access denied** can indicate an authentication or IP-ban policy; changing HTTP/HTTPS will not repair that policy. A restricted manifest endpoint may show **Connection failed** until a real image download succeeds.

## Apply Configuration

After making changes, tap **Apply Configuration** at the bottom of the page. The panel restarts and loads your new settings — you'll see a message while it reconnects.

## Restart From Home Assistant

Each EspControl device has an enabled **Restart** button in Home Assistant. Open **Settings > Devices & services > ESPHome**, choose your EspControl device, and look under its configuration controls. Pressing **Restart** safely restarts the display without changing its cards, brightness, schedules, or other saved settings.

You can also press the button from a Home Assistant automation. Replace `button.your_panel_restart` with the Restart entity shown for your display:

```yaml
actions:
  - action: button.press
    target:
      entity_id: button.your_panel_restart
```

If the automation runs when Home Assistant starts, wait until the Restart entity is available before pressing it:

```yaml
actions:
  - wait_template: >
      {{ states.button.your_panel_restart is not none
         and not is_state('button.your_panel_restart', 'unavailable') }}
  - action: button.press
    target:
      entity_id: button.your_panel_restart
```

The web setup page's **Apply Configuration** button remains separate: use it after saving web settings, and use the Home Assistant **Restart** entity when you only need to restart the display.

## Naming Your Panel

On firmware that supports panel naming, open **Settings > System > Device Name**.
Enter a name such as **Kitchen**, check the address preview, then choose
**Save & Restart**. The name appears in the web interface, browser tab, the
panel's network information and Home Assistant. The address becomes something
like `kitchen-b2c3.local`; the four-character suffix comes from the panel's MAC address.

The page shows the new address and current IP before restarting. Reopen the panel
using either link. Router-managed DNS entries may need updating separately.
Clearing the name restores the firmware's original name and address. Normal OTA
updates retain your custom name; older firmware without naming support uses its
compiled defaults.

Home Assistant should update the existing device after reconnecting. A name you
assigned manually in Home Assistant takes precedence. Existing entity IDs remain
unchanged, but custom ESPHome action names include the hostname: update automations
using actions such as `esphome.<old_name>_navigate`. Reload the ESPHome integration
if its action list still shows the previous names.
